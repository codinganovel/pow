Files are opened in your configured `$EDITOR` and pow exits immediately, returning you to your shell.
---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
pow uses your system's default text editor:
```bash
export EDITOR=micro    # Set your preferred editor
export EDITOR=nano     # or nano
export EDITOR=vim      # or vim
```

If `$EDITOR` is not set, pow will show you how to configure it.
---
## üìã Dependencies
pow requires one external dependency for fuzzy search:
```bash
pip install rapidfuzz
```

If rapidfuzz is not installed, pow will show installation instructions.

### Supported Text Files
Automatically detects common text file extensions:
- Code: `.py`, `.js`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.java`
- Web: `.html`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.json`, `.xml`
- Config: `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.env`
- Docs: `.md`, `.txt`, `.log`, `.csv`
- And many more...

Files without extensions are checked by content analysis.

## üìÑ License

under ‚òïÔ∏è, check out [the-coffee-license](https://github.com/codinganovel/The-Coffee-License)

I've included both licenses with the repo, do what you know is right. The licensing works by assuming you're operating under good faith.
